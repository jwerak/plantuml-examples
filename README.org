* PlantUML Examples

K8s and AWS sprites included as git submodules.

Execute following before using them:

#+begin_src bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src


Then include them in UML using:
#+begin_src plantuml
  @startuml
  !include ./resources/k8s-sprites/resource/k8s-sprites-unlabeled-25pct.iuml
  !include ./resources/aws-sprites/dist/Compute/AWSLambda/AWSLambda.puml
  package "Infrastructure" {
    component "<$master>\nmaster" as master
    component "<$etcd>\netcd" as etcd
    component "<$node>\nnode" as node
    component "<$AWSLambda>\nlambda" as lambda
  }
  @enduml
#+end_src
